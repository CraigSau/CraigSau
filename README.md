# Hey there, I'm Craig! ðŸ‘‹

## In 2022, I will be graduating from college with a degree in Computer Science, however I am only starting to really enjoy programming.

### Some of my goals for the year are to complete more projects, overhaul my Github profile, and to contribute to an open source project for the first time.

### Stay tuned for big changes on this page!
